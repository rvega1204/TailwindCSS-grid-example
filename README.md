# CSS Grid Layout Example

This project demonstrates a responsive grid layout in a React application using **Tailwind CSS**. The grid is populated dynamically from a data source and adjusts its layout based on the screen size. The component `CssGrid` renders a grid of items with conditional spans and styling.

## Features

- **Responsive Grid**: The layout adjusts based on screen size, with 4 columns on medium screens and a flexible number of rows.
- **Dynamic Content**: The grid items are generated by looping through the `data` array.
- **Conditional Styling**: Some items span multiple columns or rows based on their index.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes utility-first classes for styling and layout.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For logic and rendering.

## Component Overview
CssGrid
The CssGrid component renders a responsive grid layout where each item is styled with a common box style and dynamically spans multiple columns or rows based on its index.

## Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling:

Grid Layout: grid md:grid-cols-4 for a 4-column layout on medium screens and dynamic row heights using auto-rows-[300px].
Box Styling: Common styles (boxStyle) for each grid item, including a neutral background, rounded borders, and padding.
Responsive Behavior: Tailwindâ€™s responsive classes (md:col-span-2, md:row-span-2) are used to adjust the span of grid items based on their index.
